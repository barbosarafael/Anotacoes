#--- Lesson 27: Self joins

Current tables:
rps
id	name	defeats_id
1	Rock	3
2	Paper	1
3	Scissors	2
employees
id	name		title			boss_id
1	Patrick Smith	Software Engineer	2
2	Abigail Reed	Engineering Manager	3
3	Bob Carey	Director of Engineering	4
4	Maxine Tang	CEO			null

Can you run a query that returns the name of an employee and the name of their boss? Use column aliases to make the columns employee_name and boss_name.


SELECT emp1.name AS employee_name, emp2.name AS boss_name
FROM employees AS emp1
INNER JOIN employees AS emp2
ON emp1.boss_id = emp2.id


Result:
employee_name	boss_name
Patrick Smith	Abigail Reed
Abigail Reed	Bob Carey
Bob Carey	Maxine Tang
